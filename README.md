## Use extreme caution when using this, once a github repo is deleted it's NEVER coming back.

### Chrome only

Deleting repos on github can a little long process(and for the right reasons because its an irreversible action) and when you have a lot of github repos to delete it can be very time consuming.

Adds a delete link to all your repos on "https://github.com/your-username?tab=repositories" page.

Opens a new page and deletes the repository automatically.

I had to delete hundreds of repos from my github account thats why I made this, its not perfeact but helped to ease up the the process a little bit.
